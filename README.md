# Diabetes-ml
.The diabetes is one of lethal diseases in the world. It is additional a inventor of various varieties of disorders foe example: coronary failure, blindness, urinary organ diseases etc.The aim of this analysis is to develop a system which might predict the diabetic risk level of a patient with a better accuracy. Model development is based on categorization methods as Decision Tree, ANN, Naive Bayes and SVM algorithms. For Decision Tree, the models give precisions of 85%, for Naive Bayes 77% and 77.3% for Support Vector Machine. Outcomes show a significant accuracy of the methods
